### Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! 🚀 This portfolio project showcases a modern data warehousing and analytics solution, demonstrating best practices in data engineering and analytics. It covers the entire process, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable business insights.

============================================================

🖥 Data Architecture
The project adopts the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three layers:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw, unprocessed data ingested from source systems (CSV files) into a PostgreSQL Server database.
Silver Layer: Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data to prepare it for analysis.
Gold Layer: Provides business-ready data modeled into a star schema optimized for reporting and analytics.

============================================================

📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on:

Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).
ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Creating fact and dimension tables for efficient analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting: Building SQL-based reports and dashboards to deliver actionable insights.

Repository Structure

🗂 The repository is organized into two main folders:

📂 data_warehouse: Contains data warehousing materials, including datasets, documentation, scripts, and tests for building and maintaining the data warehouse.

📂 data_analytics: Contains resources for data analysis, including SQL scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced analytics to generate actionable business insights.


🎯 This repository is ideal for professionals and students aiming to demonstrate expertise in:

SQL Development // Data Architecture // Data Engineering // ETL Pipeline Development // Data Modeling // Data Analytics

============================================================

🛩 Project Requirements
Data Engineering: Building the Data Warehouse
Objective

Create a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications

Data Sources: Import data from ERP and CRM systems provided as CSV files.
Data Quality: Address and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
Integration: Merge data from both sources into a unified, analytics-ready data model.
Scope: Focus on the latest dataset; historical data storage is not required.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model for business and analytics teams.

📚 Data Warehouse Resources

📁 The data_warehouse folder contains:

📂 Datasets: Source data files (e.g., CSV files from ERP and CRM systems).
📂 Documentation: Detailed data model documentation for business and analytics teams.
📂 Scripts: SQL scripts for ETL pipelines and data transformations.
📂 Tests: Test scripts to validate data quality and pipeline integrity.

============================================================

📊 Data Analysis: BI, Analytics & Reporting
Objective

Develop SQL-based analytics to provide insights into:

Customer Behavior // Product Performance // Sales Trends

🔎 These insights deliver key business metrics to support strategic decision-making.

📚 Analytics Resources

📋 datasets // Gold Layer Outputs // The final transformed and cleaned data products, including:

gold.dim_customers.csv: Dimension table containing cleaned customer data.
gold.dim_products.csv: Dimension table containing cleaned product data.
gold.fact_sales.csv: Fact table containing cleaned and aggregated sales data.

📑 Data_Analytics_Roadmap (EDA & Advance Analytics)

🗂 The data_analytics folder contains:

📂 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Scripts for initial data exploration to understand patterns and trends.

📂 Advanced Analytics Scripts: Scripts for in-depth analysis, generating actionable insights for business stakeholders.




These files represent the business-ready outputs of the data warehouse, optimized for reporting and analytics.
