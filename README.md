# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! 🚀
This portfolio project showcases a modern data warehousing and analytics solution, demonstrating best practices in data engineering and analytics. It covers the entire process, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable business insights.



🏗️ Data Architecture

The project adopts the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three layers:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw, unprocessed data ingested from source systems (CSV files) into a PostgreSQL Server database.
Silver Layer: Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data to prepare it for analysis.
Gold Layer: Provides business-ready data modeled into a star schema optimized for reporting and analytics.



📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on:

Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).
ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Creating fact and dimension tables for efficient analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting: Building SQL-based reports and dashboards to deliver actionable insights.


🎯 This repository is ideal for professionals and students aiming to demonstrate expertise in:

SQL Development
Data Architecture
Data Engineering
ETL Pipeline Development
Data Modeling
Data Analytics
