## 🖥 Data Architecture – Medallion Approach  

The project adopts the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:  

| Layer   | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 🥉 **Bronze** | Raw ingested data from ERP/CRM CSV files with **incremental loading** for efficient processing. |
| 🥈 **Silver** | Cleaned & standardized data ensuring quality. |
| 🥇 **Gold**   | Business-ready, star schema data for BI & reporting  with **robust data validation**. |

## Pipeline Automation 🚀

This project includes **automated workflows** in **Databricks** to orchestrate the **Medallion Architecture ETL pipeline**, **data quality checks**, and **advanced analytics**. The workflow ensures seamless execution from raw data ingestion (Bronze) to business-ready insights (Gold), with error handling and logging.

### Workflow Details
**Bronze Layer**: **Incremental loading** efficiently processes large-scale ERP/CRM data, reducing costs and enabling near **real-time** updates. Ingests CSV data using **Delta Lake MERGE**. Key features:

- **Upsert** via unique keys (merge_key).
- **Deduplication** using load_timestamp or columns like cst_create_date.
- Error handling and load duration logging.

**Silver Layer**: Cleans, transforms, and quality-checks data for consistency.

**Gold Layer**: Builds star schema tables (dim_customers, dim_products, fact_sales) with robust data validation via **GoldenLayerDataValidation class**, ensuring:

- No null values for data integrity.
- Deduplication on keys like cst_id, prd_id.

**Analytics**: Performs exploratory and advanced analytics.

This automation ensures scalability and reliability for **production-grade data pipelines**.
