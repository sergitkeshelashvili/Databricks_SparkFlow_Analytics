### Databricks SparkFlow Analytics 📊💸

Welcome to the Databricks SparkFlow Analytics Project! 🚀 This portfolio project showcases a modern data warehousing and data analytics solution built on Databricks using PySpark, Spark SQL, and Delta Lake. It demonstrates best practices in data engineering, ETL pipeline development, data modeling, and business intelligence (BI), covering the entire process from building a scalable data warehouse to generating actionable business insights through exploratory and advanced data analytics.

============================================================

🖥 Data Architecture
The project adopts the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three layers:

🥉 Bronze Layer: Stores raw, unprocessed data ingested from source systems (CSV files) into Delta Lake tables on Databricks.
🥈 Silver Layer: Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data to prepare it for data analysis, ensuring high data quality.
🥇 Gold Layer: Provides business-ready data modeled into a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics using Spark SQL views.

============================================================

📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on:

🪙 Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) on Databricks.
🪙 ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into Delta Lake tables using PySpark and Spark SQL.
🪙 Data Modeling: Creating fact and dimension tables for efficient analytical queries.
🪙 Analytics & Reporting: Building SQL-based reports and views to deliver actionable business insights for business stakeholders.

============================================================

🗂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

📂 data_warehouse: Contains materials for building and maintaining the data warehouse, including datasets, documentation, PySpark/Spark SQL scripts, and tests.
📂 data_analytics: Contains resources for data analysis, including SQL scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced analytics to generate business insights.

============================================================

🎯 Target Audience
This repository is ideal for professionals and students aiming to demonstrate expertise in:

Spark SQL and PySpark Development
Data Architecture with Medallion Architecture
Data Engineering and ETL Pipeline Development
Data Modeling with Star Schema
Data Analytics and Business Intelligence

============================================================

🛩 Data Engineering: Building the Data Warehouse
Objective
Create a modern data warehouse using Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.
Specifications

🛸 Data Sources: Import data from ERP and CRM systems provided as CSV files.
🛸 Data Quality: Address and resolve data quality issues (e.g., deduplication, null handling, standardization) before data analysis.
🛸 Integration: Merge data from ERP and CRM systems into a unified, analytics-ready data model.
🛸 Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model for business and analytics teams.

============================================================

📚 Data Warehouse Resources
The data_warehouse folder contains:

📂 Datasets: Source data files (e.g., CSV files from ERP and CRM systems).
📂 Documentation: Detailed data model documentation for business and analytics teams.
📂 Scripts: PySpark and Spark SQL scripts for ETL pipelines and data transformations (e.g., bronze_layer.py, silver_layer.py, gold_layer.py).
📂 Tests: Test scripts to validate data quality and pipeline integrity.

============================================================

📊 Data Analysis: BI, Analytics & Reporting
Objective
Develop Spark SQL-based data analytics to provide insights into:

Customer Behavior: Segment customers (e.g., VIP, Regular, New) based on spending and lifespan.
Product Performance: Analyze product sales, cost ranges, and category contributions.
Sales Trends: Identify temporal trends and key business metrics.

These insights deliver actionable metrics to support strategic decision-making.

============================================================

📚 Analytics Resources
📋 Datasets (Gold Layer Outputs)
The final transformed and cleaned data products, stored as Delta Lake tables:

🏅 gold.dim_customers: Dimension table containing cleaned customer data (e.g., customer_key, first_name, last_name, country, gender, birthdate).
🏅 gold.dim_products: Dimension table containing cleaned product data (e.g., product_key, product_name, category, subcategory, cost).
🏅 gold.fact_sales: Fact table containing cleaned and aggregated sales data (e.g., order_number, order_date, sales_amount, quantity).

============================================================

📑 Docs

Data_Analytics_Roadmap: Documentation outlining the EDA and advanced analytics processes.

🗂 The data_analytics Folder

📂 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Scripts for initial data exploration to understand patterns and trends (e.g., exploratory_data_analysis.py).
📂 Advanced Analytics Scripts: Scripts for in-depth data analysis, generating actionable insights (e.g., general_overview_advance_analytics_01.sql.py, advance_analytics_customers_report_02.sql.py, advance_analytics_products_report_03.sql.py).

These files represent the business-ready outputs of the data warehouse, optimized for reporting and analytics using Spark SQL.

============================================================
