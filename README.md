### Databricks SparkFlow Analytics 📊💸

Welcome to the Databricks SparkFlow Analytics Project! 🚀 This portfolio project showcases a modern 🏪 data warehousing and 📊 data analytics solution built on 🔧 Databricks using 🐍 PySpark, 💻Spark SQL, and 💾 Delta Lake. 

It demonstrates best practices in ⚙️ data engineering, 🔄 ETL pipeline development, 🏗️ data modeling, and 📊 business intelligence (BI), covering the entire process from building a scalable data warehouse to generating actionable business insights through exploratory and advanced 📈 data analytics.

============================================================

🖥 Data Architecture // The project adopts the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three layers:

🥉 Bronze Layer: Stores raw, unprocessed data ingested from source systems (CSV files) into Delta Lake tables on Databricks.
🥈 Silver Layer: Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data to prepare it for data analysis, ensuring high data quality.
🥇 Gold Layer: Provides business-ready data modeled into a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics using Spark SQL views.

============================================================

📖 Project Overview // This project focuses on:

🪙 Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) on Databricks.
🪙 ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into Delta Lake tables using PySpark and Spark SQL.
🪙 Data Modeling: Creating fact and dimension tables for efficient analytical queries.
🪙 Analytics & Reporting: Building SQL-based reports and views to deliver actionable business insights for business stakeholders.

============================================================

🗂 Repository Structure // The repository is organized into two main folders:

📂 data_warehouse: Contains materials for building and maintaining the data warehouse, including datasets, documentation, PySpark/Spark SQL scripts, and tests.
📂 data_analytics: Contains resources for data analysis, including SQL scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced analytics to generate business insights.

============================================================

🎯 Target Audience // This repository is ideal for professionals and students aiming to demonstrate expertise in:

🐍 Spark SQL and PySpark Development
🏗️ Data Architecture with Medallion Architecture
⚙️ Data Engineering and ETL Pipeline Development
⭐ Data Modeling with Star Schema
📊 Data Analytics and Business Intelligence

============================================================

🛩 Data Engineering: Building the Data Warehouse //  Create a modern data warehouse using Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

🛸 Data Sources: Import data from ERP and CRM systems provided as CSV files.
🛸 Data Quality: Address and resolve data quality issues (e.g., deduplication, null handling, standardization) before data analysis.
🛸 Integration: Merge data from ERP and CRM systems into a unified, analytics-ready data model.
🛸 Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model for business and analytics teams.

============================================================

📚 Data Warehouse Resources // The data_warehouse folder contains:

📂 Datasets: Source data files (e.g., CSV files from ERP and CRM systems).
📂 Documentation: Detailed data model documentation for business and analytics teams.
📂 Scripts: PySpark and Spark SQL scripts for ETL pipelines and data transformations (e.g., bronze_layer.py, silver_layer.py, gold_layer.py).
📂 Tests: Test scripts to validate data quality and pipeline integrity.

============================================================

📊 Data Analysis: BI, Analytics & Reporting // Develop Spark SQL-based data analytics to provide insights into:

👥 Customer Behavior: Segment customers (e.g., VIP, Regular, New) based on spending and lifespan.
📦 Product Performance: Analyze product sales, cost ranges, and category contributions.
📅 Sales Trends: Identify temporal trends and key business metrics.

🎯 These insights deliver actionable metrics to support strategic decision-making.

============================================================

📚 Analytics Resources // 📋 Datasets (Gold Layer Outputs) // The final transformed and cleaned data products, stored as Delta Lake tables:

🏅 gold.dim_customers: Dimension table containing cleaned customer data (e.g., customer_key, first_name, last_name, country, gender, birthdate).
🏅 gold.dim_products: Dimension table containing cleaned product data (e.g., product_key, product_name, category, subcategory, cost).
🏅 gold.fact_sales: Fact table containing cleaned and aggregated sales data (e.g., order_number, order_date, sales_amount, quantity).

============================================================
